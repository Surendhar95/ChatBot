Description: ChatterBot Language Training Corpus

        ===================================

        

        These modules are used to quickly train ChatterBot to respond to various

        inputs in different languages. Although much of ChatterBot is designed

        to be language independent, it is still useful to have these training

        sets available to prime a fresh database and make the variety of

        responses that a bot can yield much more diverse.

        

        For instructions on how to use these data sets, please refer to the

        `project

        documentation <https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/wiki/Training>`__.

        

        All training data contained within this corpus is user contributed.

        

        If you are interested in contributing support for a new language please

        create a pull request. Additions are welcomed!

        

        Unit Testing

        ============

        

        “A true professional does not waste the time and money of other people

        by handing over software that is not reasonably free of obvious bugs;

        that has not undergone minimal unit testing; that does not meet the

        specifications and requirements; that is gold-plated with unnecessary

        features; or that looks like junk.” – Daniel Read

        

        .. code:: bash

        

            pip install -r requirements.txt
